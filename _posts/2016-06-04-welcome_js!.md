# Check out the new JS page!

The past few days I have been studying a bit of Javascript, today I put some of it on this page just a simple table. I am currently brainstorming the way to create a proper budget app to help me keep track of my money and this is one of the starting ideas I had was using a table though I will most likely change it soon if I find a better way of doing this.

The budget app I hope to create will be free to use for the public and will be simply given its own page once it is finished, so stay tuned if you want an easy way of keeping track of your money and decidng where and when to spend it.
