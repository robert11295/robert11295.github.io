# New javascript to play with on the JS page, enjoy if that kind of stuff amuses you!

I have been working on getting down as much javascript as possible as I prepare myself to search for somewhere to start working as an intern or apprentice, I have been brainstorming ideas for apps along with other things to make myself a better candidate.

I hope to soon have some much better code to be presenting on the JS page and hopefully in the near future be capable of adding new pages that will draw attention to my blog, once it is production my budgeting app will be open to the public for use.

Thanks for tuning in even though nobody is reading this, till next time.
