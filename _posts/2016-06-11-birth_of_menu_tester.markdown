# Menu Tester X.1 in the making.

Today I started the construction of my menu trainer web app targeted toward all food serving businesses, the menu trainer will be programed toward Cubby's Chicago Beef. Though of course any interested buyers can have their own personal version used for training employees in mastering the menu of their restaurant, if interested contact my phone or email though this project is not yet finished still in early phase.
